In this little project i experimented with captcha breaking. I wanted to try
how captcha braeaking works and if it's possible to implement it in php.

To play arrount with this files you will need the following table:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `decaptcha_templates` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `solution` char(1) NOT NULL,
  `horizontalProjection` text NOT NULL,
  `verticalProjection` text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 ;
